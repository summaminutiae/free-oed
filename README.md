# The Plan #

produce a plaintext edition of the 1st ed Oxford English Dictionary
based on page scans hosted by the Internet Archive (IA).

# The Secret Sauce #

IA did a fairly accurate ocr pass on the pages, and put the results into epub
files.  Once you extract that text, the most difficult step is complete.  What
remains is:
 - organizing the text into entries
 - correcting the ocr output
 - adding markup
