** The plan

Produce a plaintext edition of the 1st ed Oxford English Dictionary
based on page scans hosted by the Internet Archive (IA).

** The secret sauce

IA completed the most difficult step by doing a rather accurate ocr pass on the
pages.  The ocr output is stored in epub files and can easily be extracted.

What remains is:
 - organizing the text into entries
 - correcting the ocr output
 - adding markup
